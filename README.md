# ISS Location Tracker 🌍🚀

This project is a **real-time tracker** for the International Space Station (ISS). It displays the ISS's current location (latitude and longitude), speed, and rotation directly on a web page. The data is refreshed every 5 seconds to keep it up to date.

## Features
- **Real-Time Location**: Tracks the latitude and longitude of the ISS.
- **Speed Display**: Shows the ISS's speed in kilometers per hour (km/h).
- **Dynamic Updates**: Updates all information every 5 seconds for accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** and **CSS**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the webpage.
